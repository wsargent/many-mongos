# mongo cookbook
This is a collection of wrappers for a mongodb install. Someone had a need for separate installs of mongo.
So I helped with a Berks wrapper.

# Requirements
This project requires an internet connection and Berkshelf to resolve dependencies. 

It also requires Vagrant if you want to pop up in a vagrant box.
# Usage
In the root of the project:
`berks install`
`vagrant up`
